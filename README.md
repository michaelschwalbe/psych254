<p>This is a github repository for work I am doing in a Stanford class on research methodology called PSYCH 254</p>

<p>In this class we will be focusing on a number of research topics and topics, among others, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>experimental design</li>
<li>javascript</li>
<li>mturk</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>r scripts</li>
<li>power analysis</li>
<li>publication bias</li>
</ul>
